# java-margin-calculator

This is the very first project I built after starting to learn how to code. I was working in e-commerce at the time and decided to build this calculator to replace the Excel sheet I was using and which I could never find... 

The calculator has been refacotored a couple of times and it is still far from perfect, but it works and has saved me lots of time over the last year or so.
